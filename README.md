# processing

Blockchain-like decentralized distributed DAG-registry for processing.
Consensus algorithms: PoA (Proof-of-Authority) , PoW (Proof-of-work).

Proof-of-authority (PoA) is an algorithm used with blockchains that delivers comparatively fast transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake.

A proof-of-work (PoW) system is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. 

### Priorities:

- decentralization, distribution
- resistance to the influence of Byzantines
- speed (at least 1000 operations per second)
- pure architecture (Uncle Bob)
